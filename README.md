# Data Analysis Portfolio

Repository for Data Analysis projects.

On this Repo I share my projects created for Data Analysis which include Web Scraping code done ethier using Power BIs built-in function or Python's BeautifulSoup Library.

All visualizations are done with Power BI.


## Projects

### 1. [Car market dashboard](https://github.com/rajcespedes/analysis_portfolio/blob/main/Car%20market%20analysis.pdf).

Dashboard for analysis of the 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers team, focused on their Standard Batting results according to Baseball Reference. Showing analysis for the top hitters by Batting Average and OPS+ also building a correlation matrix to see the most relevant stats that have more influence on each playerÂ´s salary.

The web scraping for the Standard Batting was made with Power BI and for the Contract information it was retrieved with BeautifulSoup. Here is the code for the [contract scraping](https://github.com/rajcespedes/analysis_portfolio/blob/main/contract_scrape.py) and for the correlation matrtix was used the Pandas library in Python. [Here is the code for the matrix](https://github.com/rajcespedes/analysis_portfolio/blob/main/corr_matrix_Test.py).
